# Mindstorms Sharp
Mindstorms is a C# API allowing communication and interaction with LEGO Mindstorms kits. The API is designed to be modular with only the Core module being required to get the basic features. This API is being built in .NET so only compatible with .NET Core & .NET workflows. If you need a .NET framework compatible API consider checking out [MindSqualls](https://github.com/NybbleLynx/MindSqualls) by Niels K. Handest, which is available on my own GitHub page. This API is loosely based on the work done by Niels with some needed improvements to the code structure.

### Planned Features
This project will be worked on in my spare time so updates may take some time to come out. The modules listed below are the currently planned modules for now. The API may be expanded in future
 - Core module - Core features that are shared across other modules.
 - NXT module - For NXT specific functionality
 - EV3 module - For EV3 specific functionality
